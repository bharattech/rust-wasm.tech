### Some popular runtimes for WebAssembly:

1. **V8:** V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google and is widely used as a runtime for WebAssembly. It provides high-performance execution of WebAssembly modules. [V8 GitHub](https://github.com/v8/v8)

2. **SpiderMonkey:** SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript engine used in Mozilla Firefox. It also supports WebAssembly and provides an efficient runtime environment. [SpiderMonkey GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/tree/master/js/src)

3. **Wasmtime:** Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly, developed by the Bytecode Alliance. It focuses on security, correctness, and performance and supports running WebAssembly modules outside of the browser. [Wasmtime GitHub](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)

4. **Wasmer:** Wasmer is another standalone runtime for WebAssembly. It aims to provide a universal runtime that can execute WebAssembly modules in different contexts, including browsers and server environments. [Wasmer GitHub](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)

5. **Fastly Lucet:** Lucet is a WebAssembly compiler and runtime developed by Fastly. It is optimized for running WebAssembly at scale and provides low-latency execution for serverless applications. [Fastly Lucet GitHub](https://github.com/fastly/lucet)

6. **AssemblyScript:** AssemblyScript is a TypeScript-like language that compiles to WebAssembly. It includes a runtime specifically designed for executing AssemblyScript modules. [AssemblyScript GitHub](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript)

7. **Emscripten:** Emscripten is a toolchain that allows compiling C and C++ code to WebAssembly. It provides a runtime environment called "emterpreter" for executing Emscripten-compiled modules. [Emscripten GitHub](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten)

These are just a few examples of the runtimes available for WebAssembly. Different runtimes may have varying features, performance characteristics, and supported environments, so it's worth exploring them further to find the best fit for your specific use case.
