Rust is a popular choice for WebAssembly (WASM) for several reasons:

1. **Performance**: Rust is designed to provide high performance and efficient code execution. This is crucial for running code in a browser environment where performance is often a key consideration.

2. **Safety**: Rust's strong emphasis on memory safety and strict compile-time checks helps prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races. This safety feature is particularly important for code running in the web browser, where security is paramount.

3. **Interoperability**: Rust has excellent interoperability with JavaScript, allowing seamless integration with existing JavaScript codebases. This makes it easier to combine Rust modules with JavaScript modules in a web application, leveraging the strengths of both languages.

4. **Small WebAssembly Binaries**: Rust's control over low-level details and its ability to optimize code generation result in compact WebAssembly binaries. Smaller binaries mean faster loading times for web applications, which is crucial for a smooth user experience.

5. **Community and Tooling**: Rust has a vibrant and supportive community that actively contributes to the development of tools and libraries for WebAssembly. This ecosystem provides a wide range of resources, frameworks, and tooling to facilitate WebAssembly development in Rust.

Overall, Rust's performance, safety features, interoperability, small binary size, and community support make it a compelling choice for developing applications and libraries targeting WebAssembly.
